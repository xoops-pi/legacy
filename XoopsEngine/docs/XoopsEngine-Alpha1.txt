As announced back in August 2010[http://xoops.org/modules/news/article.php?storyid=5675], XOOPS is moving forward with a brand new architecture.
After some refactoring during the past few months, today we are releasing the XoopsEngine for the public for testing as an official Alpha 1.

XOOPS, or eXtensible Object Oriented Portal System, well known as a leading open source CMS and portal system, now becomes an application engine platform for web and mobile applications.
XoopsEngine, as the new brand of the XOOPS Project, supports open and extensible engines backboned with its multi-engine architecture. As for now there are three engines available:
- Xoops: the official engine with new architecture utilized Zend Framework as primary library and Smarty as default view templating engine, as well as some third-party libraries. Demo is hosted on xoopsengine.org;
- Lite: a lite version of the 'Xoops' Engine with no MySQL required, aimed for high performance scenarios;
- Legacy: for backward compatibility to support legacy modules and templates.
During the time of refactoring, the multi-engine mechanism has been examined and proven with a couple of independent engines for different type web applications.
By taking advantages of PHP frameworks like Yii, more engines will be provided by Xoops Engine development team, and community developers are encouraged to develop their custom engines as well.

Relevant documents are still being prepared, some selected features that are most wanted by community:
* Built-in cache mechanism for high performance
* Clear M-V-C with AOP and event hook
* Extensible URL rewrite for better SEO
* App/module clone w/o code change


And the current Roadmap for Xoops Engine development in 2011:

* Alpha 1 in end January (this release), open to community conrtibution
* Alpha 2 in middle February, mainly for developers to review code and write most wanted applications
* Beta 1 in  early April, for end users to start testing
* RC 1 in June, reasonably stable for production development
* Final in early December, celebrating XOOPS 10's Anniversary

From now on, based on our experiences with previous Xoops Engine group organized in Googlegroup, we'll be forming five public teams:
1) Engine development: primary architecture, backend and front-end development
2) User extension development: application, module and plugin development
3) Documentation: development tutorials and user guides
4) Theme and design: prototype design, graphics and front-end coding
5) Testing: functionality and performance testing
If you are interested in or available for any of the teams, please feel free to join.
